(repacked in rtf because apparently github likes to mess with the readme.txt -__-)

>Open "RunRedditSearch.bat"

>Enter the Subreddit name -as it appears in the url (ie: gaming)
	-it is case sensitive; ie "Bitcoin" not "bitcoin" and "technology" not "Technology". 
	-if you're unsure just check the url
	-if the program returns nothing either the timeframe was too short or the subreddit was misspelled
	-you can enter “/r/subredditName”, but you don't need to, it just deletes the "/r/"

>Enter your search term (like congress or tesla motors)

>select a time frame (3, 4, or 5)
	-do you want 1 weeks’ worth of data, or one year's worth? 
	-Be aware collecting data from "all time" may take a while to finish)
	-you can also select 2 for week, 1 for day, and 0 for hour

>make your selection and let the program do the rest!

>DO NOT open your excel file before the program finishes! 
	-this will probably crash the program
	-if the program fails to finish the excel file will not be readable
	
PM me with your search parameters if you have any problems!
